    awareness: `
    The Gaza conflict intensified in October 2023 when Hamas launched a large-scale attack on Israel, 
    killing over 1,300 Israelis and taking hostages. Israel responded withheavy airstrikes, a 
    ground invasion, and a complete blockade of Gaza, creating a severe humanitarian crisis. 
    The violence has caused extensive casualties and destruction, exacerbating long-standing tensions 
    between Israelis and Palestinians over land, governance, and sovereignty.

      The crisis in Myanmar, which began with the 2021 military coup, has escalated into a 
      brutal civil war, with various ethnic resistance groups intensifying their fight against 
      the military junta. The coup ousted the democratically elected government, leading to mass protests 
      and violent crackdowns. Armed resistance has since grown, with widespread civilian displacement. 
      In late 2023, coordinated attacks by resistance groups, such as the Brotherhood Alliance, gained momentum. 
      The military has responded with bombings and heavy repression, threatening the collapse of the state. 
      The situation has sparked significant humanitarian concerns, with increasing civilian casualties and regional instability.

    Violent clashes and kidnappings have become daily occurrences, worsening the humanitarian situation. 
    Over 700,000 Haitians have been displaced, and nearly half of the population faces food insecurity. 
    International interventions have failed to curb the 
    violence, and humanitarian aid is hampered by the deteriorating security situation.
